# 2025-AOC-Kotlin

Kotlin solutions to the 2025 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming puzzles.

NOTE: don't expect much progress here for about a week.
Unfortunately, while I'm psyched to tackle some of these,
I simply will not have the time to focus on this for a bit.

I'm jumping around between amper and gradle builds,
and am mostly focusing on experimenting with language and build features here.

Also of note, this is not the type of code or project that is indicative of
what I would normally produce outside the context of a programming challenge, or set of puzzles.
